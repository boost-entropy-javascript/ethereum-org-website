                <p>
                  Ethereum is a technology for building apps and organizations,
                  holding assets, transacting and communicating without being
                  controlled by a central authority. There is no need to hand
                  over all your personal details to use Ethereum - you keep
                  control of your own data and what is being shared. Ethereum
                  has its own cryptocurrency, Ether, which is used to pay for
                  certain activities on the Ethereum network.

                </p>
                <p>
                  It all started in 2008 with Bitcoin. You could use it to send
                  funds to anyone anywhere globally. What made crypto different
                  from normal bank transfers or other financial services like
                  Paypal or Alipay is that there was no middle man for the first
                  time.
                </p>
                <p>Wait, what is a middle man?</p>
                <p>
                  A middle-man is a central authority like a bank or government
                  that intervenes in a transaction between the sender and
                  recipient. They have the power to surveill, censor or revert
                  transactions and they can share the sensitive data they
                  collect about you with third parties. They also often dictate
                  which financial services you have access to.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Things are different with crypto.{" "}
                  <b>Transactions directly connect sender and recipient</b>{" "}
                  without having to deal with any central authority. Nobody else
                  will have access to your funds and{" "}
                  <b>nobody can tell you what services you can use</b>. This is
                  possible because of the blockchain technology upon which
                  cryptocurrencies operate.

              <h2>What is the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin?</h2>
              <p>
                Launched in 2015, Ethereum builds on Bitcoin's innovation, with
                some big differences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both let you use digital money without payment providers or
                banks. But <b>Ethereum is programmable</b>, so you can also
                build and deploy decentralized applications on its network.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ethereum being programmable means that you can build apps that
                use the blockchain to store data or control what your app can
                do. This results in a general purpose blockchain that can be
                programmed to do anything. As there is no limit to what Ethereum
                can do, it allows for great innovation to happen on the Ethereum
                network.
              </p>
              <p>
                While Bitcoin is only a payment network, Ethereum is more like a
                marketplace of financial services, games, social networks and
                other apps that respect your privacy and cannot censor you.

              <h2>Why would I use Ethereum?</h2>
              <p>
                If you’ve ever sent money overseas (or plan to), or had to worry
                about the future of your assets due to external forces outside
                of your control where you live, or been fed up by the numerous
                restrictions and fees imposed by traditional financial
                institutions for everyday transactions, you might be interested
                in what cryptocurrencies have to offer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bear in mind that Ethereum is a story that is still being
                written, and many more reasons to use it are being uncovered as
                it evolves and develops over time.

                  <h3>Cheaper and Faster Crossborder Payments</h3>
                  <p>
                    <b>Stablecoins</b> are a novel type of cryptocurrency that
                    relies on a more stable asset as the basis for its value.
                    Most of them are linked to the United States dollar and
                    therefore maintain the value of that currency. These allow
                    for a very cheap and stable global payment system. Many
                    current stablecoins are built on the Ethereum network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ethereum and stablecoins simplify the process of sending
                    money overseas. It often takes only few minutes to move
                    funds across the globe, as opposed to the several business
                    days or even weeks that it may take your average bank, and
                    for a fraction of the price. Additionally, there is no extra
                    fee for making a high value transaction, and there are zero
                    restrictions on where or why you are sending your money.

                    If you are lucky enough to have multiple banking options
                    through trusted institutions where you live, you may take
                    for granted the financial freedom, security and stability
                    that they offer. But for many people around the world facing
                    political repression or economic hardship, financial
                    institutions may not provide the protection or services they
                    need.

                    playing the games) have recently emerged and are
                    transforming the gaming industry. Traditionally, it is often
                    prohibited to trade or transfer in-game assets to other
                    players for real money. This forces players to use black
                    market websites that are often a security risk. Blockchain
                    gaming embraces the in-game economy and promotes such
                    behavior in a trusted manner.

                    Moreover, players are incentivized by being able to trade
                    in-game tokens for real money and thus being truly rewarded
                    for their play time.

              <h2>Meet ether, Ethereum’s cryptocurrency</h2>
              <p>
                Ethereum has a native cryptocurrency called ether (ETH). It is
                purely digital, and you can send it to anyone anywhere in the
                world instantly. The supply of ETH isn’t controlled by any
                government or company - it is decentralized and completely
                transparent. New coins (also commonly called tokens) are created
                only by miners and stakers who maintain the network.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every action on the Ethereum network requires a certain amount
                of computational power. This fee is paid in the form of ether.
                This means you need at least a small amount of ETH to use the
                network.

                Turns out: a lot of things! One of the most prominent usages of
                the Ethereum technology is decentralized finance (DeFi) that
                opens entire areas of banking services to anybody with an
                internet connection. You can use your ether as a collateral to
                take out loans or provide liquidity to earn interest on your
                funds.

              <h2>Who runs Ethereum?</h2>
              <p>
                Ethereum is not controlled by any one entity. It exists solely
                through the decentralized participation and cooperation of the
                community. Ethereum makes use of nodes (a computer with a copy
                of the Ethereum blockchain data) run by volunteers to replace
                individual server and cloud systems owned by major internet
                providers and services.
              </p>
              <p>
                These distributed nodes, run by individuals and businesses all
                over the world, provide resiliency to the Ethereum network
                infrastructure. It is therefore much less vulnerable to hacks or
                shutdowns.{" "}
                <b>
                  Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has never suffered downtime
                </b>
                . There are thousands of individual nodes running Ethereum
                network. This makes Ethereum one of the most decentralized
                cryptocurrencies out there, second only to bitcoin.

              <h2>What are smart contracts?</h2>
              <p>
                <b>Smart contracts are simply computer programs</b> living on
                the Ethereum blockchain. They only{" "}
                <b>
                  execute when triggered by a transaction from a user (or
                  another contract)
                </b>
                . They make Ethereum very flexible in what it can do and
                distinguish it from other cryptocurrencies. These programs are
                what we now call decentralized apps, or dapps.
              </p>
              <p>
                Have you ever used a product that changed its terms of service?
                Or removed a feature you found useful? Once a smart contract is
                published to Ethereum, it will be online and operational for as
                long as Ethereum exists. Not even the author can take it down.
                Since smart contracts are automated, they do not discriminate
                against any user and are always ready to use.
              </p>
              <p>
                Popular examples of smart contracts are lending apps,
                decentralized trading exchanges, insurance, crowdfunding apps -
                basically anything you can think of.

            <h2>
              I heard crypto is being used as a tool for criminal activity. Is
              this true?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Like any form of money, some of it will be misused. However,
              because all Ethereum transactions happen on an open blockchain,
              it’s often easier for authorities to track illicit activity than
              it would be in the traditional financial system, arguably making
              Ethereum a less appealing choice for those who would rather go
              undetected.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crypto is used much less than fiat currencies for criminal
              purposes according to the key findings of a recent report by
              Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement
              Cooperation:
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>
                “The use of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities seems to
                comprise only a small part of the overall cryptocurrency
                economy, and it appears to be comparatively smaller than the
                amount of illicit funds involved in traditional finance.”

            <p>
              Ethereum is currently using proof-of-work mechanism that consumes
              a large amount of energy. In the coming months (Q3/Q4 2022)
              Ethereum will undergo its biggest update yet and will switch to
              proof of stake mechanism which will{" "}

            </p>
            <p>
              This update will reduce the energy required to secure Ethereum by
              about <b>99.95%</b>, creating a{" "}
              <b>more secure network for a much smaller carbon cost</b>. This
              will make Ethereum a truly low-carbon blockchain while boosting
              its security and scalability.
