The Translatathon is open and anyone can participate by filling out the application form and joining the project in Crowdin.

Translators collect points by suggesting translations for untranslated strings in their language in the Crowdin editor during the translation period (August 9th - August 18th).

Each participants final score is determined by the number of words they have translated during the translation period and any potential multipliers they’ve collected.

### Getting started

The translation process takes place in the ethereum.org project in Crowdin and translators suggest their translations for untranslated strings, made up of almost all of content from the ethereum.org website.

Translations are suggested directly in the online editor so there is no need to download or upload any files or deliverables. Each translated word is tracked and counted.

**1) Join the project**

- To start contributing, you will need to join the [ethereum.org project in Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereum-org)
- You will need to sign in or create an account - all that is required is an email address and password

**2) Select your language**

- Find your language on the list of target languages and open it by clicking on its name or flag
- If you would like to translate into a language that isn’t available, reach out to [Ethereum.org Team](https://crowdin.com/profile/ethdotorg) on crowdin or send us an email to translations@ethereum.org and we will add new additional target languages per request

**3) Open an untranslated file**

- Find the first untranslated file to start translating. The folders containing the source files are based on priority - 1) Homepage, 2) Essential learning, 3) Essentials, 4) Exploring, etc. so you should start translating the first folder that contains untranslated files
- Each file has a progress indicator showing how much of the translatable content in the file has been translated and approved… if translation progress for any file is below 100%, please translate it

**4) Translate the untranslated strings**

- When you open a file to translate, make sure you are only translating untranslated strings!
- Each string has a status indicator that shows whether it’s _Translated_, _Untranslated_, or _Approved_. If a source string already has a suggested translation in your language, there is no need to translate it
- You can also filter strings in the editor to show _Untranslated first_ or _Untranslated only_

For a detailed guide to navigating and using the Crowdin online editor, we recommend all Translatathon participants to read our [How to translate](/contributing/translation-program/how-to-translate/) guide.

To learn more about the conventions and best practices for translating ethereum.org content, you can also check out our [translation style guide](/contributing/translation-program/translators-guide/).

### Prizes

The total prize pool for the Translatathon is 30,000$.

A detailed breakdown of prizes will be announced at the end of the application period.

### Evaluation process

All translations will be subject to QA and feedback, where professional linguists will evaluate submissions based on quality and accuracy.

We will also be running **anti-machine translation measures**, with Crowdin providing some tools that automatically detect machine translations.

While translation quality will not play a critical role in the scoring, any **participants found using machine translation** or suggesting low-quality and inaccurate translations **will be disqualified** and not eligible to compete for prizes!

The evaluation period will take place between August 19th-28th and the results will be announced on the ethereum.org community call on August 29th.

All translations will also be subject to a thorough review before being added to the website.
